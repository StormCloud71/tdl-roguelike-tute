 This is a WIP (that means copying, pasting) of the Python-tdl roguelike 
tutorial. I have some hopes that it might  divert  to  become  something
more interesting in the future.

 The project has  started  deviating from the original, implementing the 
beginnings  of  a bestiary for enemy creation. Also, different sorts  of
baddies are created, to comply with my ideas for a medieval,not too high
fantasy game.
